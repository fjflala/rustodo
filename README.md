# Rustodo

This is my first application written in Rust. Basically it is a todo list application.

It uses a framework called Yew that compiles the application to WebAssembly. It is super similar to React.

I also used Tailwind for the styles.




## Development

To start the application run the following command in your terminal

``` bash
trunk serve
```


## Feedback
Please if you have any feedback create an issue and help me to understand better how rust/yew works
